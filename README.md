# XX-Backplane-Shield

This board will contain the raspberry pi 3 and act as a mounting point onto the electrnoic enclosure which will be mount horrizontally. The board will attach the IMU and the bluerobotics pressure sensor.

The raspberry pi will need an ethernet and usb cammeras plugged into it, so the size of the board was kept at a minimum to make working with wires easier.
